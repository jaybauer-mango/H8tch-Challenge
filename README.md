# H8tch Coding Challenge

Completed code challenge for H8tch as per the provided instructions. Unfortunately the Photoshop file would not open correctly, so this was built based off of the image of the PSD that Google Drive was able to give me in my browser. I also do not have Helvetica available on my system, so Arial was substituted. The end result is far from pixel-perfect, but the functionality is all there!

### Tech stack:
- Typescript
- Context API for state management
- styled-components
- webpack w/ multiple configs

### Scripts
`npm start` to run the project.\
`npm build` for production build.
